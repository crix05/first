    <!--
    An element is basically defined by tags. For example '<b> This text is bold </b>'' is altogether an element, lets say bold element. So basically an element is a combination of tags, attributes and the text within.

     id stands for identifier. Id must be unique for each and every element. -->

     <!-- Suppose that we want to give some specific characteristics or properties to multiple elements, then instead of giving these properties to the elements individually, we can create a class, define the characteristics and then include the elements in this class to give the elements these characteristics.-->

     <!-- An element can have only 1 id (mainBox below), but it can have mutliple classes (redBg blackBorder, we are talking about the value of the attribute here)  -->

    <div id="mainBox" class="redBg blackBorder"> This is mianbox </div>

    <span class="redBg"> </span>
    <br>

    <!-- The id="mainbox" has been reserved and can't be given to any other element. -->

    <h2> Emmet </h2>

    <!-- . is for class and # is for id -->
    <!-- span.redBg -->
    <!-- div#mainSpan -->
    <!-- Try the above examples once. -->

    <!-- Emmet basically acts as a shortcut and is used to save time. -->
    <!-- Emmet takes div tag as default -->

    <!-- td.myClass1.myClass2.myClass3 (for multiple classes in same element)-->
    <td class="myClass1 myClass2 myClass3"></td>
