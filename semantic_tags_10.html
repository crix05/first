    <h2> Semantic Elements </h2>

    <!-- The basic understanding of the word 'semantics' is something concerned with 'meaning of something'.
    Semantic elements specify their locations along with their purpose in the website. -->
    <!-- Semantic elements - 
        <header>
        <nav> - navigation bar
        <section>
        <article>
        <aside>
        <footer>
            etc.

            Using all these elements is not necessary for making a website, but the search engine ranks the websites higher if these elements are used.

            SEO stands for search engine optimization.
